"['Definitely not an iPhone..fast, light weight all together beautiful machine', ""The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display delivers stunning visuals with vibrant colors and sharp details. The M3 chip offers blazing-fast performance, ensuring seamless multitasking and smooth operation. With 8GB of unified memory and 256GB SSD storage, it provides ample space for all your needs. The backlit keyboard and Touch ID add convenience and security, while the 1080p FaceTime HD camera ensures crystal-clear video calls. In Midnight color, it's not just a laptop; it's a statement of style and sophistication."", ""I use my laptop for work purposes, connecting to all sorts of external multimedia equipment. I had a MacBook Pro for nearly a decade, and it was more than showing its great age. I knew I needed to upgrade, but I was worried about choosing the Air. I liked the features, I liked the slender form and low weight. I just worried it would not do what I needed it to do.I needn't have worried. This is better in every sense, and because I'd waited so long to upgrade getting a 2024 MacBook Air easily outclassed my old Pro in every category. I'll for sure never miss my Pro.It just works."", 'The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Coming from Windows PC’s this thing eats gaming laptop’s for breakfast…The MacBook Air doesn’t even have active cooling…Is thinner than my Samsung tablet and gets a steady 60fps in World of Warcraft without sweat and not even heating up…Consumes 15 watts during gameplay plugged in.Not plugged in and just browsing, word, YouTube consumes about 5% in half a day.Since I need windows for 2 or 3 things I installed parallels for running windows inside MacOS, and stills runs like Speedy Gonzales !Battery life tanks from 18 hours to 11 hours running Windows 11 inside MacOS.Nonetheless this super thin machine is a beast!', ""As a loyal Apple customer, I recently purchased a brand new MacBook with high hopes of a seamless experience. However, my excitement quickly turned to frustration when I encountered significant issues with the Touch ID functionality straight out of the box.Upon setup, the Touch ID feature was utterly glitchy, refusing to recognize my fingerprint no matter how many times I tried. It was as if the system had a mind of its own, completely ignoring my attempts to register my fingerprint. After struggling for an entire day, I finally managed to get it to work, only to find that it would still intermittently fail to recognize my fingerprint.What made matters worse was the lack of support from the Apple Store. Despite purchasing the MacBook from an authorized retailer, the Apple Store refused to initiate a return, citing their policy of not accepting returns on Apple products not bought directly from them.My advice to potential buyers is to avoid the hassle altogether and purchase directly from Apple. While I've always been a fan of their products, this experience left me deeply disappointed. The Touch ID issue, and subsequently having to return the laptop not only disrupted my workflow, but also made me question the quality assurance standards of such a reputable brand. Proceed with caution, and consider buying directly from Apple to avoid similar frustrations."", 'Waited for hours for this Apple product to arrive, like a kid waiting for Christmas Day!  Not disappointed one bit when I viewed meticulously designed box, the tissue paper wrapping and this handsome hunk of metal. Thank you Apple.', 'Received on time and in excellent condition.', 'Producto sellado en perfectas condiciones', 'I love it compared to my 2017 macbook air this is super fast', ""The device would've been excellent for the base price if it had at least 12GB RAM and a 512 SSD. For what they're currently offering, it's not worth the money."", 'Loaded up beautifully but then found it wouldn’t charge. Had to return. Very inconvenient as I use my laptop to run my business from home']"
"['Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.', 'I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding. Cannot recommend this thing enough. Great job Apple.', 'Purchased this on sale to replace a 11+ year old OG 15 inch Macbook Pro Retina, which still works perfectly despite the battery not holding a charge long. I tend to keep laptops for a long time and wanted to stay with Apple due to my experience with my last one. I waited on the M2 version for its upgrades over the M1, which I read is also a great computer. Love how fast it is, very snappy, and the specs are perfect for my heavy home office use. Setup was a breeze from an iCloud backup. Have used it on multiple Zoom and Teams video meetings and the new camera and speakers work awesome for this purpose. Hope this one lasts as long as the Mac Pro!', 'This was just what I was hoping it would be. It’s easy to toss around in my backpack. It’s fast and has wonderful graphics. I  retired recently but still need a laptop and this does just about everything. I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.', 'I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboardis about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.Multi-tasking / browsing / usageSome sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine. Farewell.', 'Great Mac product! Just what I needed', '- Surprisingly fast. Three times faster (single core, using Geekbench 6) vs early 2015 MacBook Pro 13” after upgrading the MBP with a fast SSD.- Quiet. And keyboard have sufficient depth to type. And screen is crisp. Will be great for typing, research, excel and other productivity work (though an external monitor would be the right place for excel).- Trackpad seems to work as intuitively as the 2015 MBP 13.- AAA games according to YT give 30-45 fps. I expect it should be fun to play older games if it’s your only computer.- Midnight looks great. A nice change from the usual silver. Im avoiding the case route and picking up a non magnetic sleeve to protect it. I expect scratches and dents over its lifetime. Not a big deal.- In one day, there are hardly any fingerprints on it, and they don’t bother me. I ask, are you typing on your laptop, or juggling it?', ""this Mac is the best! so responsive, light, FAST & beautiful. this is my first Mac and I can't believe the difference between this and my other computer! I love how you can message everyone, non apple included."", 'Everything about the M2 MacBook Air is well designed and executed. This is my first Apple laptop and the display, keyboard and trackpad exceed my expectations. Battery life is good and I can get a full workday and still have 20%-30% left. Quality is superb.', 'The best to do all my work in.', 'Amazing.Battery ✅ - I travel for work a lot. The battery last for over a week without charging for emails, making docs, casual internet browsing, etc. For heavy processing like creating content, decent enough to last for atleast 5 hours.No fan noise ✅ - no fan, so no noise! 😅 Im not a heavy user so this is perfect for me.Light! 🪶 ✅ - I mean, it should be cos its “air”. Kidding aside I prefer this more than an ipad pro + keyboard set up.Still getting used to it. - I transitioned from using windows for more than 20 years to using macbook just a couple of months ago. I thought it will be difficult but it isn’t. Needs a lot of getting used to, but the regular use of this surely helped a lot in the process.']"
"['Windows user here. Got tired of 1 to 2 hours of battery life on windows. Jumping into macOS with both feet. After 8 hours of setup and messing around, I have used 53 percent of my battery. Display is nice. Base 8gb and 256gb drive will meet my needs with a little cloud storage in my future. So far quite impressed. Computer is fast and I suspect it still will be once I know what I am doing in macOS. Bit of a learning curve ahead, but for average user like me ( some office apps and the rest consumption oriented) I think this is going to be perfect. Got Starlight because it was discounted. Nice color, gender neutral. Very happy with this purchase so far. Best personal computer I have ever owned. Makes my previous windows laptops look sad. Would buy again. 15 inch M3 Base model.', 'I had a 13"" M2 with 8 GB of memory and the slightly better processor. That was a great machine for general purpose stuff, but I do a lot of development, so I wanted something with a bit more oomph.This laptop is amazing. Super fast (was immediately ~30% faster at a set of python tests), and I really appreciate the larger screen and improved speakers. The screen feels much, much bigger than the 13"". That said, the 15"" definitely *feels* more like a laptop. The 13"" is small enough that it feels almost feels like a larger tablet device. The 15"", while only a half-pound heavier, really does start to feel more like a laptop because of the increased size.They\'re both brilliant machines, and all in all, I think I still prefer the 15"". But I\'d opt for the 13"" if I traveled a lot with the laptop or I was going to be taking it too/from work or school. I\'d go with the 15"" if travel was a bit less frequent. If you\'re looking for a machine for light work (office tasks, browsing, watching video, light programming), the 8 GB version is probably fine. For anything else, I\'d go 16 GB. 24 GB is probably pointless unless you\'re a massive power user (think: multiple VMs, serious programming development with big models, editing very large video, etc.), and at that point you should probably be looking at macbook pros.', 'This laptop is slim, ultra fast, great resolution, and with pleasing appearance.  Makes my PC laptop look like a horse and buggy compared to a C8 Corvette.  Great battery life.', ""It's a good buying, I've been using since March and it woks well. I'm happy with my laptop."", ""This is a Dell laptop that cost twice as much and leaves every finger on it. The midnight is seriously so bad - try to even breathe on it without leaving a stain. It is SO SO not Apple and I am Johnny Ive's is laughing. It preforms well when you can see it. DO NOT get the midnight unless you want to clean all day."", 'Bought this for school and work but later found out half of the apps I need to run will not work unless running Parallels (with diminished performance). It\'s a shame really, it\'s a beautiful device, but this ""general purpose"" laptop with a slogan of ""it just works"" doesn\'t live up to the hype and marketing.It is the fault of the app developers to not port to MacOS, but it really makes you wonder why this happens so often. Is it really that hard to develop for MacOS?I will be returning and opting for a Windows PC, which at the same price point can offer so many more features: Higher than 1080p, dedicated GPU, touch screen, expandable storage, and natural scrolling with both mouse and track pad at the same time (without having to download 3rd party software).What does Apple do better? A lot of Windows PCs have poor battery life (especially those with dedicated GPUs) and you will need to carry around a power brick which will affect portability. The speed vs weight on this thing is crazy, so if the operating system and features meets your needs, it is pretty nice.', '10/10 for me i absolutely love this computer this is my first mac ever i was always a dell user until now it came today and i unpackaged it todaay its everything i could ever imagine i recommend for anyone who wants to order a macbook on amazon', ""First, I haven't used the camera yet. I already have a 13 inch 2020 MacBook Air M1. The 13 inch is faster, has comparable viewing and just seems to fit my needs. I'm not a power user. Just the basics. I wanted to try a 15 inch and am satisfied, but if I ever need to buy another laptop, it will be 13 inch. I'm done with desktops."", 'I bought this model for my wife.  She loves it.', 'So far so good only had two weeks', ""An amazingly slender and light laptop. Of course I haven't bought a new laptop since 2013 so maybe I am just missing how good new laptops are. Nice keyboard and screen and I only wish Apple would dish these out with 1 TB SSD's as standard.""]"
"['Works great with Lightroom Classic and large photo files. Transfer speeds are super fast. Battery life is excellent.', ""This laptop has unparalleled battery life, the screen is second only to Oled the notch is annoying and unnecessary but you get over it, they should really update the software so that the icons can't overflow under the notch. The keyboard is nice but it has very little travel, the trackpad is nice as well. Macos has its flaws but almost all of them can be fixed with third party tools, ie window snapping, keyboard history, gestures, ect... Keyboard shortcuts are a must for properly navigating the os. The one major thing lacking from this mac is the ability to play most games, but there is an active effort to solve that problem, and if you're really into gaming this laptop isn't for you. Also, this is touted as being great for video editing and photo editing, it is great for photo editng, plenty powerful and color accurate, however, video editing comes with a catch, it does everything well as long as is doesn't require 3d from a gpu such as noise reduction, in that case a proper dedicated gpu puts it to shame, a clip that takes 20 mins on a desktop 4090 will take 3-5 hours on this mac. Overall, as long as you have a desktop pc to fill the gaps of heavy duty video editing and gaming, this laptop is the perfect laptop for you honestly, even as someone who hated macos before I bought this. If this is going to be your only computer, just know that you will be severely lacking in said areas."", ""I'm coming from a m1 macbook air which had 8gb ram and i switched to this one to be my main coding/work laptop. Apps like Unity, Xcode compile things so fast it's amazing, major time savor and i can have so many applications and chrome tabs open without this laptop break a sweat. One thing that also really suprised me is the quality of the speakers, so much better than the m1 macbook and also the keyboard is very comfortable/snappy to use. I'm very happy with this purchase."", 'I continue to love my Apple Products.  Dependable and well worth the money!  Thank you!  Mark', ""It's a loaded laptop for everyday need and perfect for work.

"['Great Product and amazing service!', 'Macbook Pro MVVJ2LL/A CR 16"".I needed a new Mac laptop but did not want to buy it new. I was apprehensive at first but went ahead and bought one here on Amazon. It actually arrived 1 day early. The computer came well packaged but not in manufacture packaging. The screen is perfect and the computer itself has minor scratches and a small ding on the top but nothing I cant live with. It\'s used. It has been working fine for me over the last month. No issues and super glad to replace my old Macbook pro from 2015 with this one built in 2019 for $1,000.', ""I couldn't be know happier"", 'At first, I was skeptical about buying a refurbished laptop. I bought one back in 2017 off of eBay and It was terrible the keyboard did not even last a year and it was so slow. I really needed a new laptop because of online university. My nephew accidentally ordered everything in my cart including this laptop. It was too late to cancel my order. The laptop was in mint condition. It was dirty with fingerprints and smears but I wiped it down and there were no scratches at all. The display is extremely nice. I did give it a four-star review because the battery life does not last very long but I am fine with that because I usually keep my laptop plugged in at all times. It comes with the Catalina system and can easily be updated into Big Sur. I am very happy with my purchase. I usually open about 30 tabs and it does not overheat nor crash like my previous laptop. I would definitely recommend buying from this seller.', 'First off I would like to say a Big Thank You to the folks at DoubleDex.com. My order came a day earlier than expected. The quality of the order was second to none. My new MacBook looked factory new and operated exactly like that out of the box.

No issues at all.  I'd buy from them again with no fear."", ""I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it came with a 65-watt charger. It's supposed to have a 96W Apple charger. Now, you don't just need a more powerful charger, you need the right cable that can deliver the necessary watts. So I went back and forth with different chargers, before finally figuring out the cable issue and getting an Apple cable and then my third party multi-port charger (by Aegertech) worked. Otherwise the computer was like-new and flawless, except for slightly degraded battery. (92%?) Overall I'm still happy I bought it for the price I did."", 'El equipo llegó muy bien, obvio no viene en su caja original, pero la máquina en sí es una chulada.

"['Summary: I just did my new music album with this amazing MacBook Air M2... So powerful device!!!', ""I tend to keep Macs as long as possible.  My last laptop was no exception.  My MacBook Air 2013's screen stopped working and getting the MacBook Air M2 with 16GB was quite the jump.  This thing is fast!  I love the Touch ID on it.  It's very quiet since there's no fan. Amazingly, it stays cool too.  Granted, I'm not doing much to make it hot...websites, email, music...etc.  I did transfer around 1.2TB from an old USB portable drive to one of the SanDisk extreme SSD portables and it was slow...because of the old drive.  But once the 1TB Photos was completely on the new drive, it opens in less than a second.  I'm totally digging it.  It feels like what I was used to with a couple of changes that make it easier and faster to use.  It just works.  That works for me."", ""Overall amazing computer, it's super fast and quiet and the 16 GB of RAM increases the speed a lot. The batter lasts a good amount of time, most of the day. It would be nice to have a larger hard drive. The biggest con is the need for more usb-c ports."", 'Shipped safely and promptly.

I also bought a PC gaming laptop around this same time, so I can also compare the two!  This laptop costs a little more than most comparable PCs.The build quality is spectacular.  It's like a thin, smooth, block of aluminum.  Light and rigid.  It opens beautifully and let's move onto the important parts:An entry-level macbook air might not help you much with 'gaming' or extremely compute-intensive activities (might need the Macbook Pro)... but this baby has it where it counts!  BATTERY LIFE!  I did regular web-browsing and emailing heavily for almost 6 hours straight....and the battery dropped from 100% to 98%.  No joke.  Apple has some serious technological advantage here...compare it to your current laptop and it'll beat it.  I promise.THE SCREEN!  The quality, contrast, colors, and resolution of this macbook air screen beats every PC computer I've ever owned.  It's just beautiful.THE SOUND.  I bought a low-end gaming laptop that advertises amazing Dolby DTS sound etc.....it's garbage compared to this macbook pro.  This thing is so thin and pretty, I honestly can't even find the speakers on it--  but the sound is bigger and richer than anything I've had.  I don't understand how Apple does it, but it's worth every penny.This review has gone on longer than I expected....let me just say this thing is fast, pretty, and has the best features that really MATTER for a daily laptop.  Gaming/extra power isn't what this is for, but it's perfect for absolutely all daily usage!  Cheers"", ""I never thought I would buy a Macbook but let me tell you, it is the best laptop I've ever had.  What I love about it is that it's light/thin, can hold a charge for many days and it's just the most beautiful laptop.  You do not have to shut the laptop down ever! It boots up in 2 seconds... this is just so much better than anything else.  Highly recommend."", 'Gorgeous laptop ,Perfection  BUT !!!Please keep in mind that if you return any computer purchase through Amazon.

"['I have used Mac products for over 30 years. This is  my 4th MacPro/MacBook laptop. My first one was when I was as a teacher and then I decided to buy one for myself. At the time it , was much more expensive than any other laptop, but the one I had before was not a Mac and I always got viruses.This one was also more expensive than other ones I was looking at. I’m retired now so I don’t need a laptop that much except for personal use. After looking at others, I went back and said I’m going to splurge again and buy myself another MacBook. My last one lasted me over eight years.I love that it syncs with all of my other Apple products. I have it set up so I can get my text messages when I am on my laptop and I can make my phone callsMy last laptop died suddenly. That’s when I decided not to get it fixed but get a new one and then if necessary, I would transfer all the data. If had to go to somebody, I would’ve done that.Once I put my Apple ID in ,the laptop synced with my older laptop, that was next to it. I think most of the stuff has been transferred at least the important stuff. I haven’t used it very long and I haven’t had the time to check all of my documents, but it was so nice not  to worry about losing everything when the old laptop died.One of the nicest features is the keyboard. The keys  are easy to touch and are very clear. There are no sticky buttons you can tell these are much better quality than some of the cheaper laptops.The battery is great. It lasts a very long time. I can go all day long with having it on and going on it most of the day and still have a good percentage of my battery left at night. It also charges up very quickly.I love my new MacBook Pro!', 'I purchased the BASE MODEL MacBook Pro M3. Amazon had an excellent price. Delivery was flawless. Will use it for online meetings, e-commerce, web surfing, etc.  Like the added connectivity ports of the Pro. Especially the HDMI output for external monitor.

"[""WOW.  I had a 2013 MacBook Pro that is now going to one of my grandkids, and I get to play with this MacBook Air.  From the time I started in personal computing in 1985 (Apple 2E with dual disk drives) to now, I have always bought more power than I needed.  I like to know that it's there if I need it.This Air is noticably faster than my Pro. The larger hard drive and increased RAM lets any command I give a fast swim to the screen.  I don't notice that it's a 15 and not a 16 inch.  The designers of this machine should get some kind of award. I used Windows computers for 35 years and Apple for about 3 years now.  I will never go back. I'm sure of it!  I'm 71 years old and I believe that this will be my last computer.  My desktop computer is an M1 Mini.  My God it's incredibly fast too!  The Touch ID is really appreciated as is the incredible battery life.  I'm one of those people who defaults to using a mouse.  I turn off the trackpad and use a bluetooth Apple Magic Mouse.  If you use a mouse there is no other.  The screen and resolution are so impressive. I really like the Midnight  color. I've been using it for about 2 weeks and I can't find a fingerprint."", ""This M2-based MacBook Air is thinner, lighter and more powerful than the Intel-based MacBook Pro it replaces. It arrived in excellent condition. With 500 gb storage and 16 gb memory, I'm running two editions of the Microsoft and Adobe suites: the regular Mac editions and under Windows 11 inside Parallels. This is also a great machine for video recording and editing. The battery is obviously new, and lasts more than a day. I recently had it connected to an external monitor for 6 continuous hours without going into sleep mode, and at the end of the day, the battery was still 75% full."", 'If I didn’t need a ton of ram I’d have one of these.

I like the compact feel, the slim size, the sturdiness (no flex on the screen), the magnetic snap charging cable, very quick to charge (about 2 hours to full charge from 10 - 15 %).

"['I really went back on forth on this Mac. I did not want to spend the money and would have gone with a 13 inch option, were it not for the butterfly keyboard issue. I even considered a Windows box, but since i use one in my job was very resistent to the idea.In the end the 16 inch with its magic keyboard was my only real choice. These things are so expensive, but I did realize that it was replacing a 10 year old MacBook Pro that still worked, so I guess you get what you pay for. After shopping around I got a pretty good deal from an Apple authorized seller through Amazon (saved $300). I took the 16Gb i-9 quad core with the standard video memory, slightly higher end card, and a 1TB drive all for $2499. I wanted more RAM, but read that the solid state hard drive would make up the difference quite nicely; which appears to be true.Okay, so how do I like it? I absolutely love this thing!!! It works so smoothly, so fast, and so well. No hang ups or lags, no glitches or little “we’ll fix that later” items. It’s powerful and easy to use. The keyboard feels a little different, but is not a bad tradeoff for computer slimness. The track pad took me a while to get used to, but when you do it’s actually pretty handy.I even love the touch bar, which I fully planned to hate after reading the reviews. It’s easy to customize and it does so many things just when you need them. Example, in finder, the trash can and new folder are right there (in my setup). In Quicktime it has a scrubber bar that lets you smoothly scroll to the frame you want. Oh well, some will hate it - i like it.Performance: I realize that I am coming from a 10 year old MacBook, but I also use a pretty new Dell laptop in my work, which if you throw out the docking station is a pretty good workhorse. My only real performance needs are for home video editing, and ripping and rendering movies (which i buy) for my home server. Video editing is fun again! It adds clips and photos so fast, edits like a dream, and renders like lightning. Video conversion is something else altogether...Video conversion test case: Frozen 2 on blue-ray. Ripping with Make MKV was about the same, owing to my external drive limitations, but rendering using Handbrake was phenominal (to me anyway). It rendered the movie in high quality, H264, 1080p in about 45 minutes. I am no professional, so you will have to rate that against your own experience, but for me it was fantastic!Finally, less demanding software like microsoft Office 365, Apple Pages and friends, and VLC handle quite nicely - loading documents in a flash and never hanging up hiccuping.Oh yeah, i bought two USB 3.1 adapters and one SD adapter for about $8 each, all three with the tiny plug and short cord. That allows you to use all four ports at onc, plus they are all compact and blend quite nicely.Summary: i love this computer and don’t begrudge a penny spent on it.', ""OMG!!! This is my 3rd MacBook Pro that I have owned over the past few years, and I have to say this one is by far the best one yet. This is my first Space gray, and I it's absolutely gorgeous and sleek.

And me being an animator, graphics designer and writer, I can tell the larger screen for sure.My last MacBook Pro was the 15 inch 2015, and I thought I was going to miss the glowing Apple logo, but to be honest, I don't. When I go back on my 2015, it seems so outdated. The mirrored logo looks so much more modern.The trackpad is HUGE, and I love it. My 2015 track pad seems so tiny and disappointing now.I have no idea why so many people say they hate the Touch Bar. I LOVE IT! I can not imagine life without it. It's beautiful and as a writer I love how it recommended the corrected words. I love being able to run through videos, play music and navigate more effectively. It's perfect. Well....almost. The only complaint I would say is it goes dim in dim light. I thing it should be our decision to dim it. Other than that it's perfect. I also love how easy it is to get to the emojis. 😊The Keyboard....OMG! I love it. It's so much better than the 2015. I can type so fast on this thing. It's AMAZING. I also love the backlight. It's so bright in a dark room and it doesn't bleed out like the 2015.And lastly. I LOVE how powerful this beautiful beast is. I can created my animations with no struggle. And it renders at lightening speed which means my fans of my Youtube Channel will get faster animated horror stories from me.If you are caught on the fence if you should buy it. Get off that fence right now, and BUY IT! IT'S 100% PURE PERFECTION!!!! Thank you so much, Apple.

"['efore going into details i want to say these are the best laptops on the market hands down there is no competition. I am intending this review to help people in a position of trying to figure out which model to get as a high end user and which size 14"" vs 16"". Also that there is ZERO reason to upgrade from an M1 2021 version of this laptop as it is so similar unless you have a very specific need (eg wi-fi 6e, bluetooth 5.3, hdmi 2.1) or use case (profesional video editing and time based 3D rendering projects that it would likely be a waste of money. Also sorry for an extremely long review but read it all if you want to know where things sit.I own the 2021 m1 max 32 core gpu as well as the 14 and 16 core, m2 air 8-core, a few other windows gaming laptops and macs and now m2 max 38-core gpu model. I have recently picked up this years 19 and 30 core so i know a thing or two about all of them.First I will cover 14"" vs 16"" size comparison and then go into details regarding why i daily drive the one i do and how they all compare.As you can see from my pictures i am showing a couple comparisons of the 14"" vs the 16"" for size wise. This is always a common thing to be looking at when making a purchase and portability plays a large role. Flat out the 16"" is LARGE, heavy, but packs a greater punch so to speak. The 16"" has better speakers, larger battery giving a couple more hours, clearly far more screen real estate, larger track pad, and larger fans/cooling system so it runs about 10c cooler than the 14"" at all times though i want to note neither size ever EVER overheats unlike the old intel models.Speakers- the speakers are the best in any laptop ever on the 16"" but the 14"" ones are not that far behind or enough to be mad over they still are better than any windows laptop ive heard (ive heard a lot).The larger battery- Realistically speaking in the real world were talking getting 14 hours vs 16 hours on light use so again if you have a windows machine or older mac your probably only getting 6-10 hours max anyway so even the 14"" is worth your time there.Screen- These are the best screens on the market today even against OLED as these have no risk of burn in yet still produce deep blacks. That said the screen real estate on the 16"" is MUCH more and this is where you need to stop and think about what you need from your laptop. If you do any video editing or coding you may find that the 16"" is the absolute best for you. The 14"" can feel extremely cramped while using it on the go and for me this is the only real drawback of that size. Also note that if you dock at a desk using an external monitor or your TV at home ( hdmi or casting wirelessly to airplay) this becomes a non issue and i would much reccomend the 14"" instead.Track pad- Again these are by far the best track pads made. Just like the screen if you do video editing it is much easier using the much larger 16"" versions trackpad as its a few extra inches over the already ridiculously large one on the 14"". If you use an external mouse this clearly doesnt matter and if you dont do intensive tasks like gestures constantly this also wont matter for you as both are abnormally large and amazing to use.Thermals Fans - Ok so by now you might know that the redesign with apple silicon in 2021 also came with extremely cool running laptops which is just amazing! Comparing the 14 and 16"" models as said above you will see about a good 10c difference in temps under heavy load. That said you will still almost NEVER hear the fans run. Even when they do they are so quiet youd have to put your ear to the laptop to see if that is indeed what your hearing, thats how good they are. Now, if you are putting a large CPU and GPU load on your machine doing something like gaming or 3d work here is where you might realize something that most reviewers cant attest to. The 16"" fans when at full speed (over 100c under extremely rare times that almost nobody can make it do mind you) are MUCH louder than the 14"" ones at full speed as they push a lot more air with larger blades. This is a topic that is largely glossed over because you legit cannot get your machine this hot almost ever. So the 1% out there that do this, you know who you are, get the 14"" if you care about fan sound which is the opposite of what most say because under normal use the 16"" handles heat better and doesnt spin the fans as much generally speaking.To finish the whole 14"" vs 16"" debate its of course personal preference however i personally daily use my 14"" as its way way more portable and i enjoy using it more regardless of the drawbacks stated above. I use it at the office and home desk docked with an external display so that doesnt bother me. I also air play it to my living room TV to get video editing done or use my magic keyboard and trackpad from my couch with it hooked to my TV HDMI and it works amazing. If you dont travel or you are going to keep it plugged in at all times go for the 16"" as you can enjoy the better items it can provide.----------------M1 MAX 32-core vs M2 MAX 38-Core GPU\'s as well as others-The advertised spec bump is exactly as youd imagine it is a very small increase to graphical performance. You actually get a much larger leap by the fact the base clock speed is higher than the M1 chip rather than the 8 extra GPU cores. In gaming i can say in world of warcraft that the extra 8 gpu cores actually increased framerates 65%!! This game however also has more to do with single core cpu speeds then GPU but it is a massive increase none the less. In video rednering ive seen a massive decrease which was suprising because the documentation doesnt mention it having double encode and decode engines yet it must because its walking all over the m1 max 32 core. Most other generic workloads arent going to matter with saving time but almost everything ive done and tested on these are within 10% difference in performance and probably not worth spending more money to get the M2 version unless you have a very specific need. When looking at the base models of these the 19-core in the 2023 vs 2021 provides a larger increase in performance and is a very welcomed change over last year. Since if your buying that machine you would not be pushing the envelope most things will work better then youd ever imagine or need and you may also want to cross shop the M2 air model if you dont mind the worse speakers and screen (see in store).M1 10 core cpu vs 12 core cpuThis year they added 2 more efficency cores which provides a tangable performance jump over the previous model. I can see this in daily use and i can see a large difference in battery life as well as its much more effecient. The cores run at a higher clock speed and provide just a much smoother experience multi tasking or under heavy cpu work load. Its much harder to get it to hiccup vs the older models.14"" vs 16""There is NO performance difference between the 14"" and 16"" contrary to popular belief from tech youtubers talking about thermal throttling. This is ridiculously based off of worthless benchmarks that literally max out your cpu and gpu for 10 mins straight and are not at all a normal use case so dont be fooled by those videos. I have real world experience on both. Do not base your choice on the made up metrics just decide what size phyiscally works better for your use case unless you need something very specific or NEED the extra 1.5-2 hours of battery for whatever reason that the 16"" provides.RAM / Unified memorySo you dont have that many options from the ""stock"" models that the stores get you can only choose between 16GB and 32GB which come with their own set of set SSD sizes and options but for MOST people are more then enough with any that you choose. These laptops will certainly last longer then 5 years and since you will already be spending a ton of money i highly suggest if you have any doubt to just go with the 32GB unified memory model to ""futureproof"" as many say. The 16GB though is more than capible and these machines can use what they call SWAP memory where it can write to the extremely fast SSD drive (except the base model 10/16 14"" that has a slow ssd and worse performance) and use it as unified memory in the case your running out of physical memory. So its nothing like a windows computer where you just bluescreen and crash, these do not do that it will give you many warnings and allow you to choose how to proceed instead.There is many other things you could say about these but this is already more than long enough and i hope i have helped you make a better choice on your potentially new laptop.That said if your looking for the absolute king of the jungle this is your machine! Everything is largely identical to the eye between the 2021 models and these new 2023 so keep that in mind these are just an upgraded internally with some benefits. Some of those being wi-fi 6e, bluetooth 5.3, better battery life, and HDMI 2.1 which essentially means you have more bandwidth to output a video signal over if you wish to run something like a 4k monitor at up to 240hz (2021 can only do 4k 60hz).', ""Truly amazing machine. I've been using windows pcs my whole life, and still do as my main desktop.. but have been wanting to get a MacBook to use for creative purposes for quite a long time. I was very close to pulling the trigger on the 13in w/ the Touch Bar bc i thought i really wanted that design the most.. was going to be bumping specs to 16gb/512gb.. long story short realized how much better these new m2 pros are and was like man.. i was not wanting to spend THAT much but if i'm finally getting a MacBook it just doesn't seem worth it to get an older model just bc i think the touch bar is cool. Thank goodness I did a little research. So now was about to just bite the bullet and buy this laptop via Apple Store app like i buy other apple devices and before i placed my order read in a YT comment someone saying the m2 MacBooks on amazon are $200 off rn so I was like, hold on.. ran over here to amazon and sure enough the exact machine i was about to buy full price was being sold NEW $200 off and i also wouldn't have to wait 2-3 weeks for it to arrive..!! Truly couldn't have asked for better timing, super thankful.. This means i paid only $100 more for the M2 Pro vs what I was about to pay for the 13in m2 pro w/ same ram/storage. The amount of value I gained in that extra $100 is just insane. I had not even realized the 13 in has M2 chip, but not the M2 PRO chip in the newer models. Among many other upgrades. But I will also say that even if it were full price, which i was willing to pay.. It is just all around so worth it to just spend the extra $$ for this laptop. Now since buying I have not seen the same $200 off on Amazon since that week, and heck haven't even seen any new ones available only used so.. Hopefully they can restock and do that discount again soon !"", 'Great product', ""Look, you can get a laptop for a few hundred bucks, so why spend three grand on one? This is now my main computer, so it needs to do everything, and it does. I'm a Mac person and wouldn't consider Windows ever again, but this is still a high-end Mac. And it's worth it - it's fast, silent, and can be configured with all the RAM and storage anyone might need. Think about it - the days of buying a new PC every year are gone. I expect this one to last at least five years, and I'm off to a good start. My only complaints are that Apple now purposely obsoletes hardware by preventing MacOS updates from running, and MacOS does have its quirks.

It runs cooler than the Intel 2014 MacBook Pro it replaced, and battery life is outstanding. But above all, the display is the best I've ever seen on a laptop, bar none.

A series of questions had first to be answered, with each question followed by a ""Back"" or ""Continue"" link.  I had no problem with the first few questions, but when it came to ""Transfer Information to this Mac"" I was unable to supply the information that enabled me to ""Continue"" from this point.  I tried a dozen or more times with different information that I thought might help, but to my huge disappointment I was unable to do ANYTHING ELSE on the MacBook Pro, and it was of no help to me over the whole week end.I have been an Apple enthusiast from the very beginning, but I am now using an 18 year old iMac which cannot be upgraded for various online activities, and it was my belief that the MacBook Pro would enable me to do online what my iMac can no longer do.  Alas, that is not so.  What I would like to do at this stage is to return the MacBook Pro, and purchase a new iMac.  I have selected one and put it on my wish list.I need to know; how the MacBook Pro can be returned, and the iMac delivered in replacement.Thank you in anticipation.  Richard Tubb', 'Nice and faster than my older one, but very stingy with the accessories, no extensions plug for the power cord , no adapters for the new connections , ( usb , HDMI) , not even a protective case!!!!!!', 'The stock that Amazon is selling is faulty. Mine come with a hardware issue which started after return window. Imagine getting a new laptop repaired. Neither Apple would listen that they have made a product which is faulty and would need to be replaced nor Amazon will ever help you. You are on your own! Make sure you buy directly from a store and keep an eye for the smallest problem occurring to the laptop. Just return even if they tell you it is software bug.']"
"['This laptop was one of my Christmas gifts. It has a large screen, touch key to log in and is super fast.', 'This Apple was a huge disappointment. I clocked it several times, and changing screens took 9-10 seconds! That was with 16 GB RAM!!! Thankfully Amazon et. al. honored the full refund.Instead, I bought a 17"" HP for less money, more storage, and it\'s lightning FAST with a BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY. Whew. And there\'s more...Here\'s the HP info:Model TPN-C160.17.3"" display, backlit keyboard, 1 TB solid state hard disk, 32 GB Ram, Nvidia RTX 3050, webcam, SD card reader, Wi-fi 6, and more.What a great product from Hewlett Packard.']"
